for the CrowdSale contract, 
OK you need to require a non-null token, a non-zero rate, a non-null wallet,  
OK it should accept payments within cap once deployed, 
OK it should fail with zero cap, and should reject payments that exceed the cap. 

Also the contract doesnâ€™t revert on zero-valued payments, 
not does it log high-level/low-level purchases, 
or assign tokens to the sender/forward funds to wallet on high-level purchases, 
or assign tokens to beneficary on a low level purchase, or forward funds to wallet. 
You also need to make sure the crowdsale does not reach cap if sent under the cap when ending, 
and should reach cap when ending if the cap is sent.
